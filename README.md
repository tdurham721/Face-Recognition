These are some MATLAB files I created for a research project I worked on while I was attending graduate school. The project will not be continued by me, and these files will not perform much without some programs and data that belong to the lab I was working for. These files utilize some image processing techniques, some feature extraction techniques, and supervised learning using support vector machines in order to predict outcomes about certain features of faces. The file Main.m is where the machine learning is done. It requires the LIBSVM library for MATLAB in order to function. It will not work with the Statistics and Machine Learning toolbox for MATLAB.
